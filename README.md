# **APRA** Assessment Submission (Shromann Majumder)

This is my submission for the Data Scientist role at APRA. 
My code exist in two documents
1. `./plots.ipynb`: the notebook that is used to generate all plots, feel free to open it and run all.
2. `./utils.py`: plotting utility functions that are called in plots.ipynb

All the plots are saved in `./plots` as *png*

It is okay to not run, but if one must, then to run `./plots.ipynb`, ensure you have installed python and have pip installed, as well as virtualenv
Then when inside the root project directory, type
Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

Open VSCode and select the kernal as the `venv` python and run the `./plots.ipynb` notebook.

### Future Scope:
With more time and preparation, one can develop the `utils.py` to a robust proprietary visual library
